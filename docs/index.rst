Ziamath
=======

Ziamath renders MathML or LaTeX Math expressions as SVG paths using only the Python standard library. Does not require a Latex installation, nor rely on any third party services, but rather uses math-enabled fonts, such as `STIXTwoMath-Regular <https://www.stixfonts.org/>`_ which comes included with Ziamath
for use by default. The resulting SVGs are drawn entirely with <path> elements, so the image does not depend on
having the font available.


Example
-------

To render from MathML:

.. jupyter-execute::

    import ziamath as zm
    zm.Math(
    '''<mrow>
         <mi> y </mi>
         <mo> = </mo>
         <mi> f </mi>
         <mo> &ApplyFunction; </mo>
         <mrow>
           <mo> ( </mo>
           <mi> x </mi>
           <mo> ) </mo>
         </mrow>
       </mrow>''')

|

To render from Latex:

.. jupyter-execute::

    zm.Math.fromlatex(r'\frac{1}{1-x^2}')

Ziamath is also used by the `Ziaplot <https://ziaplot.readthedocs.io>`_ and `Schemdraw <https://schemdraw.readthedocs.io>`_ Python packages, and was used for rendering the SVG and PNG equations on `MathGrabber <https://mathgrabber.com>`_.
